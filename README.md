# OOPExplained

MVC (Model View Controller) Design pattern:
- View is a UI (ti has the logic to interact wit the user.)
- Controller resides between the View and Model. And this is the brain of the architecture. All the logic is present inside it. The datasets and data which it gathers is from Model
- Model is basically reflects the real world objects.Like all the attributes of an object, and it get the data for that object from DB. 


CRUD (Create Read Update Delete):
Focuses on managing data. These are basically Database commands.

REST (Representational State Transfer protocol):
Is web service design principal, that focuses on how client and servers interact.
